"Design a modern and user-friendly 'Restaurant Detail' page for a food delivery website.
 The top section should feature the restaurant’s name, a high-quality cover image or banner, star rating,
  type of cuisine, location, delivery time estimate, working hours, and a brief description.
   Below this, display the restaurant’s full menu organized into sections
    (e.g., Starters, Main Course, Desserts, Drinks) with each menu item shown in a card or list layout.
     Each item should include an image, name, short description, price, and an 'Add to Cart' button. 
     Include a fixed or floating cart icon showing the number of items added.
      Use a clean, vibrant color scheme and clear typography.
       The page should be responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
        Optionally, add tabs or filters for menu categories and a section for customer reviews at the bottom."
