Create a modern and user-friendly Login and Signup page UI for a food delivery website. 
The layout should feature two tabs or a toggle switch at the top labeled 'Login' and 'Sign Up'.
On the Login tab, include input fields for email and password, a 'Forgot Password?' link, and a prominent
'Login' button. Below that, add a horizontal divider with the text 'or continue with', followed by Google 
and Facebook sign-in buttons with their icons. On switching to the Sign-Up tab, display fields for full name,
email, password, confirm password, and a 'Sign Up' button. Use soft food-themed colors like warm reds, oranges, 
and creams. Style the input fields and buttons with rounded corners and soft shadows. Optionally, 
place a fun food-themed illustration (e.g., burger, pizza, or chef character)
 on the side or in the background to add personality."
