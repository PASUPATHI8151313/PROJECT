"Design a responsive 'Browse Restaurants / Menu' page for a modern food delivery website.
 The layout should feature a clean and intuitive UI with a top header that includes a logo, navigation links, a search bar, and a login/signup button. 
 Below the header, include filter and sort options such as Cuisine Type, Price Range, Ratings, and Delivery Time.
 Display restaurant cards in a grid layout — each card should contain a high-quality restaurant or food image, restaurant name, cuisine type, rating (with stars), price range, estimated delivery time, and an 'Order Now' or 'View Menu' button.
 Add a featured section at the top or side showing restaurants with special offers, new arrivals, or popular picks.
 The design should also include a footer with links to Terms, Privacy, Help, and Social Media.
 Use a warm, inviting color palette (reds, oranges, greens), bold typography for restaurant names, and clean card-based UI components.
 Ensure the design is mobile-friendly with touch-optimized buttons and responsive layout."

"Design a clean and modern 'Browse Restaurants / Menu' page for a food delivery website.
 The page should display a list of restaurants or food categories in a grid or list layout. 
 Each restaurant card must include an image, name, cuisine type, star rating, price range, estimated delivery time, and a 'View Menu' or 'Order Now' button.
  Above the list, include a set of intuitive filters and sort options: Cuisine (multi-select dropdown or buttons), Rating (star-based filter), Distance (near to far), and Price Range.
   The design should include a search bar at the top to allow users to search for dishes or restaurants.
    Use a warm and appetizing color scheme (reds, oranges, yellows) and clean card-based UI. 
    Make sure the design is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing with bold text, food imagery, and proper spacing. 
    Optionally include category buttons (e.g., Pizza, Chinese, Vegan) with icons or thumbnails above the filters."
