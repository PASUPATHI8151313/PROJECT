Design a clean and functional 'Cart' page for a food delivery website. 
The page should display a list of selected food items in a vertical layout.
 Each item card must include the food name, a thumbnail image, item price, quantity selector
  (with + / - buttons), and a remove (trash) icon.
   Show the individual item total as well as the subtotal, delivery fee, taxes (optional), 
   and final total cost at the bottom of the list.
Include an editable note field for special instructions per item (optional).
 On the right or bottom (depending on screen size), add a clearly visible 'Proceed to Checkout' button.
The design should be user-friendly, responsive, and visually consistent with the rest of the siteâ€”using 
a warm and appetizing color palette.
 Optionally, include a promo code input box and estimated delivery time summary."
